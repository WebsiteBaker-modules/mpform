Release Notes for mpForm 1.3.x

General Changes
---------------
By default switched to a div-based layout. All pages created with earlier versions of
course keep their layout as it is (by default it was a table based layout in the past).
In constants.php new constants are defined for the default settings of the field loop,
and constants.user.php is introduced as a place for user-defined override of these.

The style file has been cleaned up and a few new definitions have been added
for the help popup dialog in div-based layout. Remember to copy the default style
files manually (or merge the changes into your local modifications) in order to
pick up the improved style settings.

New Features
------------
In multi page forms the access to following pages is denied to all following pages
unless the previous page has been submitted successfully

The submissions shown in the backend (more precisely the entries of the results table)
can now be exported as csv file from the backend.

Feature Improvements
--------------------
In multi page forms submissions are handed over between the individual pages so that
the last page can send confirmation mails about all the submissions of the current page
and now also all previous pages. The data is stored in the session indexed by the
submission id and could in principle be used in the private functions as well.

The {HELP} placeholder works not only in table based layouts, but in general now.

French and Italian language support did not cover the error messages in the pear
file uploader tool. These missing language files have been added now.

When deleting submissions in the backend, also the corresponding entries in
the results table can be removed now. This works for newly created results tables
and also for new entries in existing tables when the general settings are saved
in the backend once again.

Security Enhancements
---------------------

IDKEYs were not used throughout the module. In fact they were only used when
Javascript and therefore Ajax was disabled. Now the Ajax-Helpers also use IDKEYs.
Also the Noscript-fallbacks for moving fields up and down use IDKEYs now.

Documentation
-------------
The feature changes described here are also reflected in the documentation.
The standard forms have also been updated and are based on div-layout now.
Special issues concerting the update to the 1.3-series are addressed in the faq page.


Bug fixes
---------
In the 1.2.x releases the icons for import/export for these buttons have been missing.
Now they are included in the module package.

The ajax drag&drop helper did use a wrong url for a icon in one of the message boxes.
It has been corrected now.

A few other minor fixes in Ajax-Helpers, and their Noscript-fallbacks, and in
view_submission.php
