/*
 * todo list for upcoming releases:
 * ================================
 *
 * - add a checkbox for file upload to control if multiple files may be selected
 *
 * - make workflow more flexible. Right now, saving results in various tables
 *   and sending emails happens in a fixed order. Moving these steps around
 *   like it is possible to drag&drop fields would be nice, but it needs a
 *   huge redesign of evalform, by far the largest file of the module :-/
 *
 * (If you find bugs or if you would like to propose a new feature which you
 * consider useful, do not hesitate to contact me)
 *
